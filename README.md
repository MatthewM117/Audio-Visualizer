# Audio-Visualizer
An audio visualizer that displays cool and unique patterns in sync to your music!

Created with python, using librosa for the audio analysis and pygame for the visuals.

# How to Use
1. Download this repository to your computer
2. Cd into the repo
3. Open terminal/command prompt, then type: "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
4. Then type "python main.py" (you may have to install python if this doesn't work

You should be prompted to choose a file. You can select a .wav, .flac, or .ogg file (flac and ogg are untested) from anywhere on your computer.

And that's it!

# Customization
There are pleny of customization options on the left. If you are unsure what they do, feel free to mess around with them until you find something you like!

For the colours, the format is r, g, b. E.g: "32, 10, 115" (without the quotes). Inputting anything else simply won't do anything.

# Getting .wav Files
There are a few sample songs in the repository, but if you want to use your own, I recommend finding your song on YouTube, and then using a YouTube to WAV converter. This one works well: https://y2down.cc/en/youtube-wav.html
If you have an mp3 that you want to convert to a WAV file, this website works great: https://cloudconvert.com/mp3-to-wav

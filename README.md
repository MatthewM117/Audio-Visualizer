# Audio-Visualizer
An audio visualizer that displays cool and unique patterns in sync to your music!

# How to Use
Download this repository to your computer, and install python, librosa, numpy, pygame, pygame_gui, tkinter and matplotlib. (The command to install all of these is "pip3 install *library_name*" and if that doesn't work try "pip" instead.
Then run main.py.
To run it:
1. Change directories into the directory with main.py
2. Open terminal/command prompt, then type: "python main.py"

You should be prompted to choose a file. You can select a .wav, .flac, or .ogg file (flac and ogg are untested) from anywhere on your computer.

And that's it!

# Customization
There are pleny of customization options on the left. If you are unsure what they do, feel free to mess around with them until you find something you like!

For the colours, the format is r, g, b. E.g: "32, 10, 115" (without the quotes). Inputting anything else simply won't do anything.
